# APPROACH TO DO THE JS CODE

# 1 GAME WILL START ON PRESSING ANY KEY

# 2 BUTTON WILL FLASH AND LEVEL INCREASES TO 1

# 3 NOW we make to sequences what game shows the color and what user press the color.

# so we make two sequence (1) gameSeq and (2)userSeq

# if sequence same then level up

# else game over
